performance writing 

so what about a conversation that doesn't use language? 

this is a conversation without talking. 

what about not asking any questions?

ewen cameron's tape loopz (psychic driving):
"you are a good mother and wife and people enjoy your company" 
"people like you. you like people."
"there's something wrong with you, nobody likes you. you've got serious problems."
"do you realize that you are a very hostile person? do you know that you are hostile with the nurses? do you know that you are hostile with the patients? why do you think you are so hostile? did you hate your mother? did you hate your father?
"you feel friendly towards people. you like to feel intimate with others. you can get along with people by being yourself. you feel neat and tidy. if you see paper on the floor, you pick it up."
"janine, you are running away from responsibility! why? you don't want to take care of your husband! why? you don't want to take care of your children! why? why, janine? why?"
"you like to take care of your children, janine! you like to take care of your husband! if you see paper on the floor, you pick it up"

HIV!

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset
Walking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly. Please just go away

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably. You'd just throw your way...

Faget! [x3]

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay

Here I am, different in this normal world
Why did you tease me? Made me feel absurd
Fucking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly. Please just go away

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay

Faget! [x2]

I'm just a pretty boy, whatever you call it
You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
You faggot, if we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday
Who gives a fuck?!
Right now I got something to say to all the people that think
I'm strange and I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty-boy feeling
Like I'm enslaved to a world that never
Appreciated shit
I WILL SUCK YOUR DICK AND FUCKING LIKE IT!

He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anysay
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anyway
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, not going to say
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anyway
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anysay
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, not going away
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, not going to say
He had my gun but he had a body mighty, anyway

I'm just a pretty boy, I'm not supposed to fuck a girl
I'm just a pretty boy, living in this fucked up world [x2]

All my life, who am I? [x11]

All my life!

I'm just a faget!
Faget!
I'm a faget!
Faget!
I'm not a faget
What am I?
Faget!
You mother fucking queers!

performance writing 

(or trying too not use the backspace, it's difficult .)

but, automatic 

however, automatic

i was taking with k about critique and we agreed that institutional academia is shit and the economy of capital and cred is total fuck all. i am wary of a critique of critique i'm wary of my own ability to express anything. so k suggested that maybe talk (about performance) is unnecessary, in so many wayz, and i agree'd. the codification of work through language seemz to severely affect a number of detailz around history, memory, cannon, professional, and a large number of thingz that there's simply no time or ability to talk about. fuckin language, ya know? 

so anyway, all the thingz were happening at once in one small alley in old town portland. addressing dear with a dear. pedestrian: a knocked-over broom stood up. the glass wall, there was inside and outside but cordz and people ran through. purple light & framing happen at valentine's. i felt kin with performerz & audience. i said to jm that it was way less packed than last time. and now i compare my experience, however automatic.
